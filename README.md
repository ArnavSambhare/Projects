<br>
[Black-Scholes-Merton Options Pricing Model](https://github.com/ArnavSambhare/Black_Scholes_Merton_Model) This contains the code to calculate the price of a call/put option using the Black Scholes Merton Option Pricing Model. The model also contains functions to calculate the option delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho.
<br>
[GARCH(p,q) Volatility Model](https://github.com/ArnavSambhare/GARCH-Volatility-Model) An easy-to-use python class to estimate the coefficients of a Generalised AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model. The model is very flexible with p and q (the number of lagged terms to be included) passed as parameters to the class while initialisation.
<br>
[Estimating VaR using Monte Carlo simulations](https://github.com/ArnavSambhare/VaR_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_GBM) A flexible Python tool to estimate the VaR of a Stock using Monte Carlo Simulation.
<br>
[Python Backtest Engine for testing trading strategies](https://github.com/ArnavSambhare/Backtest-Engine) A flexible tool for testing trading strategies.
[Neural Network for predicting volatilities](https://github.com/ArnavSambhare/VolatilityPredictorNeuralNet) A complete pipeline to load raw data, process the data, train the model and generate predictions.
